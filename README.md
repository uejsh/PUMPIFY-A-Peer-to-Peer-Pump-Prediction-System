## Pumpify – Market Intelligence System 🚀

A data-driven system analyzing wallet behavior and on-chain activity to identify insiders and predict crypto market movements through attentional analysis.

---

## Overview

Pumpify is a market intelligence system built to understand who is driving crypto movements and why. Unlike traditional technical analysis, Pumpify focuses on **wallet behavior, on-chain attention, and intention**, producing a statistically grounded predictive metric: the **Pumpability Index**.

The system is structured in **three analytical layers**, each refining the reliability of insights:

## Core Components

### 1. Insider Detection
- Tracks wallet behavior across chains and ecosystems.
- Applies three statistical filters to identify wallets most likely to be insiders.
- Patterns are validated through recurrent behavior analysis, improving reliability as more data accumulates.

### 2. Attentional Analysis
- Measures hype-driven attention using on-chain data, avoiding noisy social media signals.
- Applies principles from utility theory to quantify the “size” of attention for each wallet.
- Computes attention trends across multiple timeframes to identify spikes and emerging trends.

### 3. Predictive Layer – Intention & Market Trends
- Uses trends in attentions to predict market movements.
- Combines attention with detected insider activity to refine pumpability estimates.
- Produces a single, unified metric: the **Pumpability Index**, representing the probability and potential magnitude of a token pump.

## How Pumpify Works

Data Ingestion → Filter Wallets → Compute Attention → Predict Trends → Pumpability Index

1. **Data Ingestion:** Pull on-chain data, wallet transactions, and token metadata.
2. **Filter & Analyze Wallets:** Apply insider filters and recurrent behavior detection.
3. **Compute Attention:** Quantify hype-driven attention and trend spikes.
4. **Predict Trends:** Use attentional analysis to forecast potential market movements.
5. **Calculate Pumpability Index:** Combine layers into a single, actionable metric.

## Features

- **Cross-chain Analysis:** Track wallets and activity across multiple blockchains.
- **Noise Reduction:** Focuses on on-chain attention to avoid social media hype bias.
- **Scalable Statistics:** Accuracy improves as more data accumulates.
- **Unified Metric:** Pumpability Index combines insider activity, attention, and intention into a single measure.

## Philosophy

Pumpify is grounded in statistical rigor, on-chain analytics, and behavioral theory.  
It treats attention as a measurable, predictive signal and combines it with observed insider behavior to anticipate market trends more reliably than conventional methods.

> “Pumpify doesn’t chase hype. It quantifies it.”

## 🌍 Vision

Pumpify is more than a tool — it’s a movement.  

Our goal is to **decentralize alpha**: to take power out of centralized hands and put it into the hands of anyone willing to learn, analyze, and act.

- **For the underrepresented:** Young people in Nigeria and around the world who don’t have access to insider information or expensive tools.  
- **Against centralization:** Challenging the systems that hoard market knowledge and opportunities.  
- **Empowerment through intelligence:** By understanding patterns, attention, and behavior, anyone can gain insight and act with confidence.

Pumpify combines data, analytics, and cognitive rigor to make market intelligence accessible and actionable — not just for a few, but for anyone ready to rise.

> “Pumpify is a movement to give the power of insight back to the people.”
